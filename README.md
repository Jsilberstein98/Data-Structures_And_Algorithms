# Data-Structures_And_Algorithms


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Answer: In this course, I worked to identify run times and efficiency of programs involving abstract data types. We worked through several different models to identify possible best applications for different data structures.


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Answer: Like any problem, I approached it from a top-down viewpoint to remain objective and non-discriminatory towards any specific data structure that I found more difficult than another. I also dissected the  problem based on what the needs of the assignment were and where I needed to go with it.


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Answer: I overcame many of the roadblocks by using the resources available to me and ensuring that the quazlity of my work never suffered based on my fatigue or exhaustion of a problem. I also welcomed any learning opportunity to strengthen my skill and knowledge of data structures, in an attempt to better understand the material I was working through.


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Answer: The work in this project has expanded the scope of my approach to software design and program development by ensuring that I understand the different aspects involved in the project, along with using my time efficiently and to the most of my ability to create the best program I can. In the end, I need the program to be something that I am proud of, and am okay showing to other people.


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Answer: The work on this program has furthered my understanding of maintainability, readability, and adaptability by increasing my knowledge og programming to match that of this project. I feel as though I am understanding the neccesity for a program to be adaptable to several different structures as well as readable and understandable for the program to be maintained by others other than the original developer.
